      <h1>How to start taking photos of stars with a phone<h1>
      <p>You all looked at the stars one night and thought, "Damn, how many of them are there. They are just so beautiful to admire. Wait, let me try to catch them on camera." <br>So, you took out your phone, opened the camera, and tried to shoot, but it only resulted in black photos. And then, you asked yourself, "Wait, how do those guys on Insta and Facebook take such beautiful photos? My phone doesn't capture any at all." <br>Has this ever happened to you? <br>Let me show you the way to take mesmerizing pics of the stars in no more than 5 minutes.</p>
      <p>You open your phone's camera app again, scroll through the camera modes, and stumble upon "Pro camera*." You might feel overwhelmed by the number of settings you see there, but don't worry. I am here to explain the most important ones to you.</p>

      <h2>ISO</h2>
      <div class="imageP">
      <img src="./Images1/ISO.jpg">
      <h3>It is a setting that determines the sensitivity to light: the higher it is, the brighter your image will be. However, increasing it comes at a cost: the colors will be washed out a bit, and noise will appear.</h3>
      </div>
      <h2>Shutter speed or Exposure time</h2>
      <div class="imageP">
      <img src="./Images1/Speed.jpg">
      <h3>This setting determines the amount of time your camera captures light. The more time, the brighter and more objects are captured by the sensor. However, images will become shakier if you hold your phone with your hands.</h3>
      </div>
      <h2>Focus</h2>
      <div class="imageP">
      <img src="./Images1/Focus.jpg">
      <h3>It sets your camera's focus distance. Usually, at the beginning of the slider, it is the nearest, while at the end, it is set to infinity, which means it will focus on the farthest objects.</h3>
      </div>
      <h2>White balance or WB</h2>
      <div class="imageP">
      <img src="./Images1/WB.jpg">
      <h3>This controls the temperature of your photo. Going to the extremes of the slider could introduce noise, so be careful. </h3>
      </div>
      <p>These are the most important settings for the PRO mode. <br>And now you might wonder, "Okay, but how do I set these in order to capture those stars?" <br>Psst, here are the cheat codes for beginners:</p>
      <p>White Balance:</p>
      <ul><li>4000k is neutral, which will give a gray color to the sky, providing the most natural colors.
          <li>More than 4000k will make your image warmer, giving it a yellowish hue.
          <li>Less than 4000k - colder, resulting in bluer tones.
      </ul>
      <p>Focus:<br>Set it to maximum or infinity.<br><br>Exposure time:<br>The sweet spot on most smartphones' cameras is between 10 seconds and 15 seconds. Using less than 10 seconds will make your image too dark. However, if you use more than 15 seconds of exposure time, the stars will start to appear as lines instead of dots due to their motion.<br><br>ISO:<br>Usually, 1600 is the best, but you could also try 3200 for more stars to appear, or lower it to 1000 for a cleaner result.</p>
      <p>Play with these settings on your phone until you achieve the desired result.<br>

Perhaps you already know that to capture a picture of the stars, you have to be far from cities and sources of light pollution. The sky should be clear.<br>

And you might ask, "But how can I get clear photos without a tripod? My hands are shaky, and I don't have one with me right now." Simply grab a table chair and something to hold your phone in position, like a towel. If you don't have those, just lay your phone on the ground, with the camera facing the sky.<br>

Now that you know how to capture pictures of the night sky, go ahead and try it yourself. Impress your family and friends with your newly acquired skill.<br><br>Bonus: Here is my very first picture of the stars:</p>
